# Photolabs
Photolabs is an educational project aimed at honing React fundamentals. The application showcases a practical understanding of state management across diverse components within a well-organized codebase.

Within the app, users can seamlessly interact with photos sourced from an API. Features include exploring each photo, liking images, expanding their view, and filtering by topics. Leveraging the capabilities of React, Photolabs ensures a fluid and intuitive user experience, eliminating the necessity for a multi-page application structure.
